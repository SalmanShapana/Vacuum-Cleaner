# Vacuum Cleaner Project
This project is a simulation of a vacuum cleaner program built using Python. The program is designed to simulate a vacuum cleaner navigating a room and cleaning up dust and debris.

## Features 

- The program can simulate a vacuum cleaner navigating a room.
- The program can detect dust and debris on the floor and clean it up.
- The program can display the progress of the vacuum cleaner as it moves around the room.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vacuum-cleaner.git
```
2. Run the vacuum_cleaner.py file by typing python vacuum_cleaner.py in the terminal:

```
python vacuum_cleaner.py
```

3. The program will simulate a vacuum cleaner navigating a room and cleaning up dust and debris.

## Tasks

The tasks of the vacuum cleaner program are as follows:

- Move forward until it hits an obstacle (e.g., wall).
- Turn right 90 degrees and move forward until it hits an obstacle.
- Turn left 90 degrees and move forward until it hits an obstacle.
- If there is dust or debris on the floor, clean it up.

The program will continue these tasks until the entire room is clean.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more intelligent navigation and cleaning algorithms to make the vacuum cleaner more efficient.
2. Implement a more realistic simulation of a vacuum cleaner, including sensors and obstacles.
3. Add the ability to save and load cleaning patterns for different rooms.
